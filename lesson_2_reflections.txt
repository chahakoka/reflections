What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize a repository and additional hidden directory and other files are created
so that the git processes can work, otherwise I have a directory but not a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's not like the repository because I can change the files there. It's not the same as a working directory because it tracks files that have changed.
